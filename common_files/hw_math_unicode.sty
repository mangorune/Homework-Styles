  % unicode-math changes the behavior of bold math, and therefore affects vectors.
  % Now this method works as it should, so the previous kludge is unnecessary.
  % This supercedes my old vector code.
  \renewcommand{\vvec}[1]{{\mathbf{#1}}} % Arbitrary vector (bold)
  \renewcommand{\uvec}[1]{\hat{\mathbf{#1}}} % Unit vector (bold, hat)
  \renewcommand{\vmat}[1]{{\mathbf{#1}}} % Arbitrary matrix (bold)
  \renewcommand{\umat}[1]{\hat{\mathbf{#1}}} % Operator (bold, hat)

  % The name for \umat was concieved of as an analogue of uvec
  % But it's a dumb name
  % widehat feels too wide sometimes but it's good enough for now
  \renewcommand{\op}[1]{\widehat{\mathbf{#1}}} % Operator
  % I'd like to be able to change the state labels without necessarily changing
  % normal vector names
  % For the moment I've decided state vector labels shouldn't be bold
  % \renewcommand{\state}[1]{\mathbf{#1}} % State Vector Label

  % Per ISO 80000, true mathematical constants (e, i, π) are best typeset upright,
  % not italic, just like units (m, kg, Å) and mathematical operations (sin, lim)

  % An upright pi for the mathematical constant
  \newcommand{\mathpi}{\mathrm{\pi}}

  % Define '\incr' for the increment operator, commonly refered to and typeset as
  % Greek Capital Delta, but which in fact has its own Unicode code point and
  % LaTeX operator --- the ISO standard. Appearance may vary significantly or not
  % at all depending on typeface.
  \renewcommand*\incr{\mathop{}\!\mathbin{}∆}

  % Fix extending arrows
  \setmathfont[
  range={
    `=,\Longrightarrow,\Rightarrow,\Longleftarrow,\Leftarrow,
    \harrowextender,\longrightarrow,\rightarrow,\longleftarrow,\leftarrow
  }
  ]{Asana Math} % Asana is closer to Tex Gyre Pagella in style than XITS is.
  \renewcommand{\relbar}{\mathrel\harrowextender}
